# TimeGuess on the Raspberry
You can find step-by-step instructions on how to get the raspberry side of the TimeGuess game running below.

## Installation

Locate the file `installScript.sh` in the `raspberry` folder. 

Run it: ```sudo bash installScript.sh```

If any problems occur, please have a look at [Java und Bluetooth Low Energy auf dem Raspberry Pi](https://git.uibk.ac.at/csat2410/skeleton-bleclient/tree/master) and follow their installation guide.

## Build

Locate the file `buildScript.sh` in the `raspberry` folder. 

Run it: ```sudo bash buildScript.sh```

If you decide, for whatever reason, to build it with tests and javadoc, you need to make sure that:
- the central backend is up and running 
- the file `timeGuessBackendUrl.txt` in the folder `bleclient` contains the **correct URL of the backend**

Those steps are also **essential** steps before running the execution script.

Then locate the file `buildScriptWithTests.sh` in the `raspberry` folder.

Run it: ```sudo bash buildScriptWithTests.sh```

## Execution

Make sure that the **backend is running** and that you write the **correct URL of the backend** into the file `timeGuessBackendUrl.txt` in the folder `bleclient` or create such a file if it doesn't exist, **before** running the execution script. You can get the IP of the backend by executing the following command on the computer you are running the backend on: 
- windows: `ipconfig`
- linux: `ifconfig`

Also make sure to **delete the file `timeGuessDiceId.txt`** (if existent) in the `bleclient` folder before execution of the program, **if it's going to be the first execution** of the program on the raspberry **after a fresh start of the central backend**. The ID which is saved in that file is only valid and registered with the backend as long as the backend is running.

The dice should be assembled and lying on a straight surface.

Locate the file `executeScript.sh` in the `raspberry` folder. 

Run it: ```sudo bash executeScript.sh```

I strongly recommend to have a look at your terminal to check if everythings works as it's supposed to. 

Example of an ideal output:
```The discovery started: true
...
Found 1 TimeFlip device(s).
Found TimeFlip device with address 0C:61:CF:C7:CF:01 and RSSI -48
Connection established
backend URL file exists
backend URL successfully read from file
URL of backend: http://192.168.0.220:8080
ID file exists
ID successfully read from file
TimeFlip password input successful
Connection thread started.
Battery thread started.
Battery level: 87
POST request response status: 200
notifications should be turned on now
```
After this point you can start throwing your dice. I recommend cleanly putting the dice on each of its facets at least once, ideally on a straight surface. That way the mapping of the facets of the TimeFlip dice will work the best.

To stop the program at any time, just press `CTRL+C`.

### You're having problems?

If no TimeFlip device is found during discovery, please try to change the battery (take the battery out of the dice and put it back in). This is a universal fix for any dice related problem.

If there occurs a fatal error after starting the program for the first time, our suggested solution is: 
- just ignore the fatal error
- change the battery of the TimeFlip device (The program didn't stop properly so the dice had no chance to disconnect. Battery change is the universal fix for this.) 
- wait a few seconds after the battery change
- re-run the program (it should *really* work this time...)

If any other exception is thrown after execution, please try to just re-run the program. It usually just magically works the second time.

If you make it to the point where it says "notifications should be turned on now", and you're getting response code 200 for all REST calls (battery, facet change etc.), you should be good to go.

If nothing helps and all fails, please don't hestitate to contact me, Diana Gr√ºndlinger (diana.gruendlinger@student.uibk.ac.at), and I will do my best to make it work for you! :)
