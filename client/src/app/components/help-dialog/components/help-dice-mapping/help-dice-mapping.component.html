<p>You can use the default mapping for the TimeFlip dice or create your own.</p>

<p>
    If you want to create your own mapping, you have to give it a name (so you can identify it from the list) and set
    the action, points and time (in seconds) for each facet (there are 12).
</p>

<p>If you want to edit one, you simply have to give it the same name and set the according values.</p>
